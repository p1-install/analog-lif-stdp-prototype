STDP Simulation Summary

n_pairs: 120
initial_weight: 128
final_weight: 0
R_syn_initial_ohm: 50694
R_syn_final_ohm: 1000
tau_mem_ms: 10.0

Observations:
- Weight decreased (potentiation) as expected for pre->post pairing with dt=+10 ms.
- Membrane response amplitude increased for the final (potentiated) weight due to lower synaptic resistance.
